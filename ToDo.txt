To be implemented:

(OK) -> Calculate Standings after simulation
-> After season is complete, calculate schedule using previous standings
    (OK) -> Store playoff games
    (OK) -> Simulate playoff games
-> Generate results of season
    -> Store results of season
-> Extend simulation to multiple years
-> Write initial skeleton of thesis with main points
    -> Send Max for initial review
-> Model draft pick according to statistical distribution of previous drafts
-> Simulate games properly using RAPTOR
-> Process after season was ended
    -> Calculate win shares for each player of the championship team
    -> Calculate additional metrics for each player
    -> Save metrics into table
    -> Repeat for each team
-> Do statistical analysis on championship teams -> what contribution is more important? Draft,
previously signed players, trades?
    -> How many players with ppg > 20 a team needs?
    -> Think of additional questions...
