To be implemented:

(OK) -> Calculate Standings after simulation
-> After season is complete, calculate schedule using previous standings
    (OK) -> Store playoff games
    (OK) -> Simulate playoff games
(OK) -> Generate results of season
(OK) -> Extend simulation to multiple years
(OK) -> Add existing rosters to JSON file
-> Simulate games simply using points per game
    -> Add game_stats table with mapping to game
    -> Game simulation logic -derive gaussian distribution (mean, std) for each player at start of the season
        -> Mean = average of player
        -> Std -> linspace : for 30 points it's 30%, for 10 pts 50%, for 3 pts 100% - as approximation based on 3 values
        -> See analysis_points_scored_per_game.ipynb
    -> Simulate games so that each player has its own points total, assists total, minutes, etc
-> Write initial skeleton of thesis with main points
    -> Send Max for initial review
-> Process after season was ended
    (We want players' metrics, what does a team look like)
    -> Calculate win shares for each player of the championship team
    -> Calculate players with points per game
    -> Save metrics into table
    -> Repeat for each team
-> Model draft pick according to statistical distribution of previous drafts
-> Do statistical analysis on championship teams -> what contribution is more important? Draft,
previously signed players, trades?
    -> How many players with ppg > 20 a team needs?
    -> Think of additional questions...
-> If enough time: simulate games with more sophisticated logic (e.g. RAPTOR)
